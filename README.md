# TJ Bot
<img src="/images/tjbot.jpg" width="85%">

[IBM Watson Maker Kits](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot) is a collection of DIY open source templates to connect to [Watson services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html) in a fun way. [TJ Bot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot) is the first kit in the collection. You can 3D print the robot or laser cut it, then use one of the available [recipes](recipes) to bring him to life! #TJBot

Better still, you can create your own custom recipes to bring exciting ideas to life using any combination of Watson's Cognitive API's!

**TJ Bot will only run on the Raspberry Pi.**

# Get TJ Bot
To build out the bot, you can download the design documents and 3D print or laser cut it from [ibm.biz/mytjbot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot).

# Build TJ Bot

# Bring TJ Bot to life
[Recipes](recipes) are step by step instructions to help you connect your TJ to [Watson services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html).
The [recipes](recipes) are designed based on a Raspberry Pi. You can either run one of the available [recipes](recipes) or create your own recipe that brings sweet ideas to life using any combination of [Watson API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html)!

Also, check out some [featured TJ Bot recipes](featured/README.md) created by the community.

# Contribute to TJ Bot
TJ Bot is open source and we'd love to see what you can make with him. Here are some ideas to get you started.

    - Visual recognition. TJ has a placeholder behind his left eye to insert a Raspberry Pi camera. Try connecting the camera to the Watson Visual Recognition API so TJ can say hello when he sees you.

    - IoT. The Watson IoT service lets you control smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, LIFX lights, etc. ). Connect TJ to IoT and have him control your home.

    - Connected robots. You can program multiple TJs to send messages to each other using the Watson IoT platform.

If you have created your own recipe, we would love to include it as a [featured recipe](featured/featured_recipes.md)! Just submit a pull request for your receipe instructions and code and send a link to a demo video to tjbot@us.ibm.com (Vimeo & YouTube preferred). We will review it and if we decide to include it in our repository, you'll be listed as the developer.  Please note that all receipes will be published under the Apache 2.0 License. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We cannot wait to see what you build with [TJ](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot)!
