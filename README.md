# Hi, I'm TJBot!
I'm an open source project created by [Maryam Ashoori](https://github.com/maryamashoori) at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/)  to help you use artificial intelligence services and make it fun and easy to interact with [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/products-services/)! 

> 💡 Check out my [TJBot Wiki](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki) for more information and detailed instructions on how to build me and bring me to life!

## Build Me
I work with a Raspberry Pi and you can build my body using a 3D print or laser cut.

> 🤖 Check out the instructions for [building me](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki/Build-TJBot).

## Bring Me to Life
I use a combination of special hardware -- a light, a servo motor, and more -- along with IBM's Watson AI services to listen, speak, shine, and wave my arm. 

> 💫 Check out the instructions for [bringing me to life](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki/Bring-TJBot-to-Life).

## Play with Me
Recipes are pre-written instructions (written in computer code) that make me perform various actions. For example, I can listen to your voice and change the color of my LED! There are so many different ways we can play together and I look forward to seeing what we can do together!

> 🧑‍🍳 Check out my [official recipes](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki/Official-Recipes) to get started. Then, take a look at receipes created by members of the #tjbot community!

> 🫶 After checking out my own recipes, check out the [recipes created by membmers of the #tjbot community](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki/Community-Recipes).

## Troubleshooting TJBot
TJBot was designed for Raspberry Pi. It requires a minimum of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (2016), but it works great with newer models such as the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5.
