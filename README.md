# Hi, I'm TJBot!

I'm an open source project created by [Maryam Ashoori](https://github.com/maryamashoori) at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/)  to help you use artificial intelligence services and make it fun and easy to interact with [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/products-services/)! 

> ðŸ’¡ Check out my [TJBot Wiki](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki) for more information and detailed instructions on how to build and bring me to life!

## Build Me
I only work with a Raspberry Pi and you can build my body using a 3D print or laser cut.
> ðŸ¤– Check out the Wiki [Build TJBot](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/wiki/Build-TJBot) section.

## Bring Me to Life
Recipes using IBM's Watson AI services allow me to see, hear, speak, and shine. I can also help you translate languages and even have fun with you by playing games.

After checking out my recipes, you can take a look at featured recipes created by members of the #tjbot community!
