## Issues
If you encounter a problem with TJBot, you are welcome to submit an issue. Before that, please search for similar issues. It's possible somebody has encountered this issue already.

## Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repository, please fork the project and create a pull request. Your commit request needs to be in the following format:

```
	(#idOfIssue) Simple description
	More details. This line is optional.
```

If there is no issue related to your commit, create one first. It will be better to understand the goal of your work. After your Pull Request (PR) has been reviewed and signed off, a maintainer will merge it into the master branch.

### Legal stuff

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach &mdash; the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](DCO1.1.txt) &mdash; that the Linux&reg; Kernel [community](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a pull request, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the pull request description.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>
```
